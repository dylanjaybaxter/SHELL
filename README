CPE 357 Asgn6
Author: Dylan Baxter (dybaxter)
Special Instructions: None
Other Notes: My code adds a newline after interrupting a process, which is
different from the provided function. There is also a macro in mush2.c that
toggles colored CWD. Also, this class has been difficult, but also an absolute
pleasure. Thanks for teaching the way you do.
